# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview
The decision-makers at PyBer need information on the total weekly fares based on city type for ride-sharing. Our goal is to make a graph that can compare weekly fare profits in urban, suburban, and rural cities.
# Results
![fares](https://github.com/James-Harkin/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/PyBer_fare_summary.png?)
* The graph shows that population directly relates to total fares. So urban always has the highest profit.
* They tend to follow the same trend. As fares increase in urban they also tend to increase in suburban and rural as well; and vice versa.
* The urban data seeems to be the most effected by trends, because it is more spikey. You could say the city provides more variables that effect peoples transportation choices.
# Conclusions
* The company did very well in the second half of February and that could be investigated more.
* The begining of the year saw a dip in revenue for the two most profitable areas.
* Going against common trends, in early April, Urban spiked while Suburban dipped.
